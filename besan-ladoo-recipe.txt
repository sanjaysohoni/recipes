author: dassana
recipe type: sweets
cuisine: north indian
serves: 2-3
ingredients (measuring cup used, 1 cup = 250 ml)

    2 cups besan or gram flour
    ½ to ⅔ cup ghee (add more ghee if required)
    1 cup powdered sugar or boora
    4 cardamoms, powdered in a mortar-pestle
    1 or 2 tbsp golden raisins

how to make the recipe:

    dry roast the besan in a kadai or pan on slow flame for about 11-12 mins.
    keep on stirring continuously right from the beginning. so that the besan is not burned and so that there is even browning.
    while roasting the besan, melt the ghee and keep aside.
    after 11-12 minutes of total roasting time, add the melted ghee and continue roasting the besan for some more 5-6 minutes stirring continuously.
    the besan would start to give a nice nutty fragrance and will start releasing ghee.
    once you get a strong nutty fragrance then switch off the fire.
    remove the pan from the stove and keep down.
    add powdered sugar or boora. for best taste use the boora.
    stir well so that no lumps are formed.
    add the powdered cardamom and raisins. you can also add chopped dry fruits at this stage. stir well.
    once you have mixed the besan ladoo mixture well then let it cool down to room temperature.
    make small or medium sized besan ladoos and store them in air tight container.

notes
if you are unable to form the ladoos even when the mixture has cooled completely, then keep the mixture in the fridge for 20-30 mins. the ghee will solidify a bit and you will be easily able to form the besan ladoos.
